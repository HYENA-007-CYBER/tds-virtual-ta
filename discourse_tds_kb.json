      "Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 4 - Data Sourcing.\nDeadline:\nSunday, June 22, 2025 11:59 PM\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@HritikRoshan_HRM",
      "Subject: Issue with Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan JSON Forecast\nQuestion 4: Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan Weather Forecast\nI’m trying to retrieve the JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan using the BBC Weather API. However, I noticed that the BBC website lists the city as “Astana” instead of Nur-Sultan. When I attempt to use the JSON data for Astana, I encounter the following error:\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)\nHow should I proceed to correctly scrape the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan? how can I resolve the TypeError issue? Any guidance on handling city name",
      "Hello,\n@Jivraj\n\n@carlton\n\n@HritikRoshan_HRM\nIn GA4 Q2 it is mentioned that result changes as per location. I am getting this error:\nAt [4].title: Values don't match. Expected: \"5. La Nuit des clowns\". Actual: \"5. Clown in a Cornfield\"\nBut when checked manually, the result I got was correct as per the filters applied. The difference seems to be due to region-specific variations in IMDb search results.\nCan you please clarify what should be done in such cases? Should we proceed with the region-specific result, or is there a standard way to align the output with the expected values?",

What is it for?\nThe larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by\nElaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question\nSharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed\n-  Are there any rules for posting in this category?\nBefore you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like “AQ1.1 Q3” which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - “Need help in calculating the\nN\nth\nprime number”\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\nUse of abusive/strong language\nPosting support/logistics related query\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors.

      "Can some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?",
      "From the graded assignment we can’t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.",
      "Apart from what\n@CKPIITM\nobserved about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway…\nThe week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective. It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What’s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker. Neither does give me much understanding anyway. It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up. The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I’m willing to hear different opinions.\nI’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.",
      "I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.\nHopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.",
      "I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.",
      "As of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week. Will continue after all other ML courses are done…",
      "Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.\nIn the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.",
      "Adding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.",
      "Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.\nThe other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.",
      "I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.",
      "As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.",
      "well, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.\nThe recording was perhaps done much earlier as\n@CKPIITM\npointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them.\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.",
      "Imagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.\n@Anand",
      "CKPIITM:\nI know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning.\nwasn’t it you who wrote this earlier",
      "But this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn. I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.",
      "I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.\nIn my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.",
      "I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.",
      "I too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with\n@anand095\nand\n@akruti\n.",
      "Interesting! Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we’re challenged…and the recent posts show that we indeed are different! It’s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too…\nI think I’m starting to understand the other points of view…well I’m trying to"

      "@s.anand\n@carlton\nSir i am done with my api endpoint for project 1 but i did one change in the given test file where we have to edit our api endpoint and test it as mentioned in the project description. I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.\nIn this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain “110”. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show “110” because this doesn’t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.\nAnd also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again. So is it okay ?",

      "i am currently running it in local host 8000 other functionalities are working this is the problem data scraping",
      "Okay, I will explain it to you.\nUpon visiting discourse and signing in with your account, you get ‘cookies’ containing information that can be used to authorize you. These cookies are sent with each subsequent request you make to discourse, if the website does not recognize these cookies, they simply reject your request with a status code of 403.\nIf you want to scrape the posts, you need to get these cookies. So, where are these cookies stored? Well, just sign into discourse with your IITM account (in Chrome). Then, visit the following URL:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/session/current.json\nOnce the page has opened and you can see JSON data, do the following:\nright click > inspect > application > cookies > https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/.\nNow, you will see a bunch of cookies, which are similar to a python dictionary containing key-value pairs. You only care about two such keys, one is _t and the other one is _forum_session.\nSave the value of these cookie keys in a python file like my_cookies.py:\n# my_cookies.py \n_t = \"your _t cookie\"\n_forum_session = \"your _forum_session cookie\"\nNow, these can be imported into other files using:\nfrom my_cookies import _t, _forum_session\n\nauth_cookie: dict = { '_t' : _t , '_forum_session': _forum_session }\nNote that these cookies keep changing, when you make new requests you get different values that replace the current values of your session. You can think of the session as a user.\nNow, look at my previous reply:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/help-required-in-project-1-scrapping-discourse-data/179153/2?u=23f1000917\nThe requests module is used to send requests to websites in python. You need to install it using pip install requests. You create a session object and add your cookies in it. This automatically handles the changing and replacement of cookie values when you make requests.\nSearch for a tutorial on the requests module to understand how to make requests using it. Just know that you can do the something like this:\nimport requests \n\nURL = \"https://example.com/latest_threads.json\"\nsession = requests.Session()\nresponse = session.get(URL)\nif response.status_code=200:\n    data = response.json() # get json data \nLastly, watch the live sessions conducted by IITM on 10th June and next few days. You can find them in your google calendar.",

In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\nThank you.",

The current deadline of June 14 is unfortunately clashing with several other academic and co-curricular commitments.\nWe have Paradox Fest scheduled just before the deadline, along with multiple assignment submissions across other courses. Due to this, I am finding it difficult to allocate sufficient time and focus towards completing the project with the quality it deserves.\nI genuinely want to put in my best effort for this project and would be extremely grateful if the deadline could be extended by a few days to allow for proper completion.",
      "Yes date shoud be extended.",

Please consider this and extend the deadline.\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@s.anand",

So I checked the available models using:\nllm model list\nAt that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed.\nI then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I’m now facing the above authentication error.\nTo test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn’t need any credits to be purchased)\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free\nThis worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.\nI’m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the llm CLI. I’ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven’t been able to resolve this.\nCertainly! Here’s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end:\nI also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin llm-openrouter), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the llm documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this:\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\nHowever, even this approach didn’t work for me.\nCould you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue?\nThank you for your time and help.\nSincerely,\nMeikanda Sivam"

      "@22f3000680\nMy only comment here would be, in TDS we do not use html, css or js for creating what the user will see. For us the reason to know this is to help us extract data. We will not be creating any user frontends. For a developer, they will use these technologies to create front ends, validation etc. We leverage them for data extraction as data scientists.\nsqlite (or more broadly databases) again will be used purely from a data extraction perspective. We will not require you to learn how to create them or modify them.\nThe goal in TDS is not to make you a developer, but rather to understand how to leverage technologies to source, extract, transform and deploy data in a useable form,\nwhich is very different from being a software developer. Granted there are significant overlaps when you learn these technologies and tools. Being good at TDS will inevitably mean you will be significantly well equipped to create end to end solutions.\nLearning html, css, javascript, sql will give you the capability to develop web sites etc, but we are never going to create one and so we will not spend time learning how to build one.\nNice map!\nKind regards"

      "I don’t know where to start… But let me share this screenshot (part of “uv” installation)…\nHere, I really did not understand, what I’ve to do, and why? What I don’t have to do, if any?\nAlso don’t know anything about PyPi, Cargo, how they are related to “uv”…\nMore importantly don’t know whether this is a valid doubt or not too. More over, how to express doubts in almost every line (some times feeling shy too).\nAs we (most of the students) are not ready to take up this course (with so many such stupid / doubts), it increases load on the instructors, TAs, and every teaching staff.\nFrom students side, this is causing lot of distress, as we struggle to raise so many doubts and get them clarified. By the team we read a line and try to understand what it means, we get another doubt.\nI strongly feel that “Diploma in Programming” (or set of subjects) must be made as a pre-requisite to this (TDS) course and any other such courses too.\nAlternatively, we have to create BRIDGE course sort of thing and make it a part of formal curriculum to reduce stress and distress in students and make teaching staff life better.\nI don’t know whom do I need to take this up, but request our TAs to carry our voice / message to the concerned authorities.\nThanks,\nPrasad.",
      "Just to share my difficulty, another example I wish to share is here below…\nAs mentioned in the screenshot / instructions, I’ve downloaded “README.md” file and then tried to run the specified command “npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum” (I don’t know, what it means and what it does, but still blindly tried to run). I get the below error (screenshot given below). It says \"term ‘npx’ is not recognized.\nTo be honest, I don’t even know (however, based on the videos I watched, I think I’ll have to run somewhere in Linux. Is it same as “powershell”? ) where exactly I need to run the command.\nI’m throwing stones in dark. Unfortunately, even when I get correct answer (like Questions 1 thru 3), I don’t know what that means and what I achieved.\nThis is frustrating (I understand how much it will frustrate our instructors, when we don’t even know what we know and what we don’t know).",
      "Some one guided me that I’ve to install Git & run these commands from Git Bash terminal. I’ve installed Git and tried to run “npx” command from there. Is this not “Git Bash” terminal?\nThis will be my last doubt posting here. Not planning to post any more doubts as our instructors by know understand, our level and how to handle us OR help us from here.\nOthers can keep adding their own doubts as they feel necessary.\nThanks,\nPrasad."

      "For TDS, you have to understand what the tools are and practise using them. Build little proof of concepts.\nHaving a separate dev environment is usually a good idea incase you mess up the system. WSL (if you are using windows) is usually a good option to do that because many of the tools are primarily linux tools.\nThis does not mean you cannot use another os. Just be prepared to face more challenges. MacOS typically is very similar to linux in the shell. Chief difference is usually not the commands but the installation method for software packages. Nearly any linux command and software package works the same in MacOS with some minor differences in only a very few cases.\nWindows is the worst of the bunch, because there are some tools that downright do not work on windows and the problems and instructions are usually completely different and including the commands for powershell. Be prepared for spending a lot more time if you are going windows only approach (without a linux vm or wsl). However if you are already comfortable with powershell and the cli quirks of windows then its fine.\nBottom line: there are no shortcuts. Practise the concepts. Start early. All the study material is fully available on the site before the term starts (last term). But remeber that TDS changes each term so make sure to check the current term material as well.\nKind regards\ntds.s-anand.net\nTools in Data Science"

This inconsistency has resulted in a correct answer being marked as incorrect, despite the fact that the same query was previously accepted by the evaluation script of Graded Assignment without any issue. Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students.\nI respectfully request that you review this matter and ensure that the evaluation criteria are consistent across the evaluation scripts. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process.

      "Hi Premdeep,\nWe will update your score to consider \\n for SQL query.\nI had briefly read your post and incorrectly assumed that the script was not handling newline characters (which are invisible whitespaces).\nThe prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear.\nWe should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This question does not require formatted text, but it does require handling of quotes.\nYour response has literal a \\ and literal n characters. It fails the copy paste test. If it had the invisible actual new line characters encoded then it would be parsed correctly. In your own image that you shared you did not copy paste the return response of your function into your GA.\nI also looked at your repo and the mistake you made for this question was you used a multiline string for the SQL query. The result of the json.dumps for this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \\n that we do not parse. We are only parsing for quotes which our script does handle.\nAs a result, I would like to reiterate, your return fails the copy paste test.\nTherefore we will not be able to award you marks for this. There are many students who got this correct. I suggest you to check out some of their repos to see why they were able to get the right answer.\nKind regards\nTDS Team",

The inconsistency between the evaluation scripts for the Graded Assignment and Project 2 has resulted in a correct answer being unfairly marked as incorrect.

      "@carlton\n@s.anand\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nSir\nI wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission.\nMy project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn’t use http or https in the URL—it’s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding.\nWith due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern.\nI don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!).\nTo be honest, I initially thought TDS would be easier compared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I’ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects—except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund.\nSo, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily.\nI’m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment—just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort.\nPlease consider this message as a humble and respectful request—I’m just exercising my right to politely express a concern.",

On our end everything is correct. Its a portal problem.\nKind regards",
      "No Sir, It is the same and please help me with the grace marks to pass the course. I only need 1.5 marks. Please sir Help me with it.",
      "@carlton\nSir Did you Found any solution regarding this because there is no change in the Dashboard.",
      "Hi Utkarsh,\nEven if the marks change to your actual marks, operations will not give the 1.5 marks for passing, but I am more concerned about the difference in the dashboard, because it might affect some others as well. So thanks for letting us know.",
      "Thank you sir for addressing it.",

      "Greetings sir ,\n@jkmadathil\n\nI am a diploma student currently in the last term of this level but due to Grade U, I wouldn’t be able to complete this level by next term. I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn’t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn’t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I’ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course. So it’s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn’t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn’t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I’ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request.\nThank you sir\nsincere regards"

      "Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it’ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!\nThe sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it’s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I’ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.\n@s.anand\nsir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\n@carlton\nI’m sure it wasn’t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions.\nI still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I’d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.\nThanks\nRegards,\nShivaditya Bhattacharya",
      "Hi\n@22f3000819\n,\nFirst of all congratulations on scoring a S grade in the subject claimed to be the hardest of all in the program, its truly a feat of its own. This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs\n@carlton\nand\n@Amit1\nback in May’24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term .\nThis course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off.\nAll the best for your next term.\nBest Wishes\nSaransh Saini\nTDS TA",
      "This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all by now ). I had the technical background and as\n@22f3000819\nmentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time.\nThe best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things.\nEverything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with\n@ItsMeAlex\n,\n@trebhuvansb\n,\n@23f1002382\nand\n@22f3002933\nfor Project 2.\nMy Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall “S” grade.\nAlso I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with\n@Jivraj\n,\n@Saransh_Saini\nand\n@carlton\nsir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by\n@s.anand\nsir and sir’s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective.\nWhen we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities.\nAt last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox .\nThanks & Regards\nPradeep Mondal",
      "My TDS Journey\n“A Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks”\nSo, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)—took the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term. Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, “Eh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?” (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you’re into academic masochism.\nThe first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one . Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos.\nDid all 7 GA …it was very time consuming but fun too …learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic , the modules were well-structured , and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group, where the real MVPs reside .\nThen came Project 1. Ah yes, my nemesis. I’d write code, it would run perfectly, then—bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable⚠️. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence . The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff , and I wasn’t sure if I could salvage an B—or even a C, honestly… with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn’t have expected more… no?\nEntered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad —my saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2—100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques…definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks… this deal got sealed with a confident A …\n.…drumrolls…\nAn A.\nThis course was brutal, but in the best way possible . It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions, and existential crises over debugging . But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I’ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience🚀.\nLooking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers—building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn’t over. Because what’s data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex?\nFor future students? Take it later in the diploma, enjoy the mad ride, and remember—even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger.\nMassive thanks to\n@s.anand\nsir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to\n@carlton\nsir,\n@Saransh_Saini\nsir, and\n@Jivraj\nfor patiently resolving our chaotic issues .\nYour guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything!\nTDS—difficult, enlightening, and totally worth it.\n(This gracious furry benefactor granted us a deadline extension—P1 survivors can relate #thanks_to_carlton_sir, we know how crucial that was. So, signing off with a furry and really grateful thank you! )",

    "posts": [
      "Hi\n@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\nsir,\nI appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”\nTo filter such logs, we need:\nTime → for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod → to filter POST\nURL → to filter /images/\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\nTime, Method, URL\nTime → needed\nMethod → needed\nURL → needed\nReferer → not needed, but not harmful\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\nThe other options were as follows:\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n\nCorrect Answer(s):\nPUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\nGET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\nDELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\nIncorrect Answer:\nPOST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\nThank you",
      "Agree & second all thoughts shared by\n@24f2003130\nabove.\nI also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .\nThe valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.\nAlso, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.\nRequest you to please clarify and consider these points.",
      "Yes\n@carlton\nthe wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list filtered_entries.",
      "Clarifications on Queries\nWhich of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format?\nDue to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response.\nHTTP method is idempotent\nThis question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent.\nEntries with 404 status code\nAlthough the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.\nWhich of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”?\nOption A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because:\nOption B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL\nOption C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page\nOption D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement",
      "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\nRedundancy in Option A:\nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\nSimplicity in Filtering:\nFiltering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\nTime → for checking the hour and weekday.\nMethod → to filter only POST.\nURL → to ensure the request is under /images/.\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\nConsistency with Log Parsing Practices:\nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.",
      "Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post.\n\nCan you please look into it?\nThanks\nRegards,\nShivaditya",
      "@iamprasna\nsir , the scores have been updated on the dashboard as well and the answer for the question in point 3 is still the same\nAdditionally , sir I have attached the snapshot of a dec’24 TDS PYQ which is a replica of this question and the answer for the same is mention the first option.\nThe link for the same has been attached for your referance\ndrive.google.com\nIIT M FOUNDATION DIPLOMA FN EXAM QDF2 22 Dec 2024.pdf\nGoogle Drive file.",

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit",

Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\nBest regards,\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama",

The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you.
